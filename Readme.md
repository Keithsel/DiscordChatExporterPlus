# DiscordChatExporterPlus

This is a fork of **DiscordChatExporter** with the political cancer, popups & notices, protestware "sanctions", general discrimination against Russian people, etc removed.

This fork acts as a drop-in replacement for DiscordChatExporter, and is set to update from this fork instead of upstream. Upstream is treated with minimal trust, therefore commits from upstream and the dependencies owned by Tyrrrz are reviewed to avoid supply-chain attacks and insertion of political bloat.

----

**DiscordChatExporter** is an application that can be used to export message history from any [Discord](https://discord.com) channel to a file.
It works with direct messages, group messages, and server channels, and supports Discord's dialect of markdown as well as most other rich media features.

> ❔ If you have questions or issues, **please refer to the [docs](.docs)**.

This application comes in two flavors: graphical user interface (**GUI**) and command-line interface (**CLI**).
Supported operating systems are Windows 7 or higher, macOS 10.13 (High Sierra) or higher, and Linux.

## Installation

To install this fork, download the [latest release](https://github.com/nulldg/DiscordChatExporterPlus/releases/latest) and extract the zip into an empty directory.

If you already have a copy of DiscordChatExporter and wish to switch to this fork, you can simply overwrite the existing files. Your settings will be preserved.
